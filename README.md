# 🧠 AnimateFlow

A creative playground for mastering **GSAP** animations in **Next.js**.
This project is part of my motion design journey — experimenting with smooth page transitions, scroll-based animations, and immersive UI motion effects.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Next.js** – React framework for modern web apps
* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – high-performance animation library
* **TailwindCSS** – for clean and fast styling
* **TypeScript** – for type safety and better developer experience

## 🎯 Goals

* Build reusable animation utilities for Next.js
* Explore scroll-triggered and timeline-based animations
* Experiment with creative UI motion and 3D-like transitions
* Document progress and share learnings

## 🧩 Structure

```
/app             → Next.js app directory & pages
/components      → Animated components & sections
/hooks           → Custom hooks for GSAP logic
/utils           → Animation helpers and configs
/styles          → Tailwind & global styles
```

## 💡 Inspiration

> "Motion tells a story — every scroll, hover, and transition should feel alive."
